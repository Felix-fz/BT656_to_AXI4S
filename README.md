# BT656_2_AXI4S

## TODO
- Deinterlace by scanline interpolation
- Upscale for hdmi (minimum 25MHz pixel clock)

## setup
In my testing i used an [FCB-EX1010](https://www.image-sensing-solutions.eu/fcb_ex1010_p.html) camera block as video source and connected it to [this analog video decoder board](https://github.com/dylanmsu/ADV7180_to_Pmod). As the FPGA i used the Digilent Zybo Z7-20 development board, but any board with three pmod ports in a row should also work.

I connected the output of the block diagram below to an ILA (Integrated Logic Analyzer) and succesfully extracted an image out of the waveforms in python, code for that comming soon.

Send me a message if you want the video interface board and i'll ship you one for â‚¬60.
